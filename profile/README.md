This project was born in 2018 from the idea of two students from Siena, Italy to create an application for mobile devices able to let users discover the places of historical and cultural interest in their vicinity, providing brief descriptions about them.

*Nice Places is available as [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niceplaces.niceplaces) and as a [progressive web app](https://www.niceplaces.it/en/app/) in both Italian and English.*

In 2022, the project became open source to allow anyone to contribute.
